This project served as my final project for the class Software engineering CSC 180 using the template from Svelte app.

The idea of this app is to provide users with the number of minutes needed for different kinds of basic pasta listed with 3 levels of cookednesses (firm, 
avg, or soft) with user's ability to add user-specific noodles. The initaitive of this app is because once I cooked a whole box of pasta and threw away 
the box right away without checking the number of minutes needed. Ended up having to dig in my trash to be able to read the number of minutes needed. 

To further the functionality of this app, the user will be able to extend the existing list of noodles with noodles they like and their corresponding 
times for the 3 cookedness. Such that user can select their favorite noodle and be able to view the number of minutes needed for the cookedness they like.
Unfortunately, the desired functionality of adding a timer was not implemented due to time restraints for this class. Regardless, this app still demonstrates
what it was planned to do, aka demonstrating number of minutes needed for specified pasta noodles listed & 3 cookedness, while the user is able to add in
noodles of their liking.
