Proposal for project
do a branch

User selects different kind of pasta & the level they want it cooked from a built-in list.
The app sets a timer or just shows the amount of time appropriate for the boiling time of that specific kinds of pasta they entered. 
The users can also add in user-specified kinds of pasta and their cooking time.
